# ROS-Tests
These are my Robotic Operating System tests with the Trossen Robotics's ReactorX 150 Robot Arm

The whole system runs on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit.  After ROS is set up on the board,the Interbotix Robotic Arm ROS package needs to be set up on the system. That can be done from the [Interbotix GitHub](https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_arms)
